### CoffeeScript + Family & Friends

| Name | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) | Unfancy JavaScript |
| [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) | Unfancy JavaScript |
| [CoffeeScript II: The Wrath of Khan](https://github.com/michaelficarra/CoffeeScriptRedux) | Rewrite of the CS compiler |

#### Family (share genes with CoffeeScript)

| Name | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| [Coco](https://github.com/satyr/coco) | A CoffeeScript dialect that aims to be more radical and practical, also acts as a test bed for features that get imported in CoffeeScript. |
| [LiveScript](http://livescript.net) | A fork of Coco that is much more compatible with CoffeeScript, more functional, and with more features. |
| [IcedCoffeeScript](http://maxtaco.github.com/coffee-script/) | A CoffeeScript dialect that adds support for \`await\` and \`defer\` keywords which simplify async control flow. |
| [Parsec CoffeeScript](https://github.com/fab13n/parsec-coffee-script) | CS based on parser combinators. The project’s aim is to add static metaprogramming (i.e. macros + syntax extensibility) to Coffee Script (CS), similar to how Metalua adds such features to Lua. The resulting compiler, once merged with the official compiler, should be usable as a drop-in replacement for it. |
| [Contracts.coffee](https://github.com/disnet/contracts.coffee) | A dialect of CoffeeScript that adds built-in support for contracts. |
| [Uberscript](https://github.com/jstrachan/coffee-script/blob/master/TypeAnnotations.md) | A CoffeeScript fork that adds type annotations which are compiled to Google closure compiler type annotation comments. |
| [ToffeeScript](https://github.com/jiangmiao/toffee-script) | A dialect of CoffeeScript that support Asynchronous Syntax and Regexp operator =~ |
| [Caffeine](https://github.com/ich/caffeine) | A dialect of CoffeeScript that supports packages and classes import, useful for browser applications |
| [heap.coffee](https://github.com/syg/heap.coffee) | A dialect of CoffeeScript that offers a C-like type system with manual memory management |
| [EmberScript](http://emberscript.com) | Ember.js-infused CoffeeScript. |
| [BlackCoffee](https://github.com/paiq/blackcoffee) | CoffeeScript with hygienic macros. See also [#3171](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/pull/3171) |
